This folder (Resources/GamePfs) exists for the purpose of the /spawn command, allowing you to spawn and kill prefabs inside your lobby.
To set up your prefab make sure it is located within this folder and the prefab has the PhotonView component attached, then you can build and use it in the game.

--------------------------------------------------------------

The syntax to spawn your prefab in game is:

/spawn [PREFAB NAME] [TAG] [LOCATION] [ROTATION] [SCALE]

Which would for example be:

/spawn Barrel Barrel1 0,0,0 0,0,0,1 1,1,1



Barrel refering to the actual prefab name you placed in this folder.

Barrel1 being a tag attached so you can easily target this model using /kill without killing other spawned Barrel models. 
(If you have duplicate tags all barrels with the same tag will be removed.)

0,0,0 the position coordinates in X,Y,Z (0,0,0 would be the world's center.)

0,0,0,1 being the rotation values in X,Y,Z,W (If you're unsure how to use quaternions, there's plenty of euler angle > quaternion converters online.)

1,1,1 being the size of the model in X,Y,Z (1 being the default size of the model.)

--------------------------------------------------------------

The syntax to kill your prefab in game is:

/kill [TAG]

Which would for example be:

/kill Barrel1



This will kill any object with the Barrel1 tag added in the initial spawn command.
